<font size = "3"> This project aims to build an optimal <span style = "color: brown"> **regression machine learning model** </span> to predict the median house price in any district in California. Property investors and real estate agents can benefit from being able to accurately predict and know the trends of house prices.<br/>
<br/>
**Models built**: Linear Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machine, **Random Forest (final model)**, Gradient Boosting

## Mobile Phone Price Predictor <img src = "images/picture2.png" style = "width: 4%">
#### [**click here to view Github Repository**](https://github.com/chonieny/Phone_Price_Classification_project)
<p class = "comment">
<font size = "3"> This project aims to build an optimal <span style = "color:brown"> **classification machine learning model** </span> to predict a phone’s price range given the phone’s features. In the context of the competitive mobile phone market, knowing the associations between the features of a phone and its selling price, and being able to accurately predict the phones’ selling prices are beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
**Models built**: KNN, Naive Bayes, **Support Vector Machine (final model with accuracy 91%)**, Random Forest

## Liver Disease Predictor <img src = "images/picture3.png" style = "width: 5%">
#### [**click here to view Github Repository**](https://github.com/chonieny/Liver_Disease_Classification_project)
<p class = "comment">
<font size = "3"> This project aims to build an optimal <span style = "color: brown"> **classification machine learning model** </span> to accurately predict whether patients will develop liver-associated disease. As one of the most common causes of death worldwide, liver disease is responsible for nearly 2 million deaths or more per year. Thus, being able to accurately predict whether someone might have liver disease is not only beneficial but crucial, especially for ones who have comorbidities.<br/>

## Factors Associated with US Hate Crime Rates <img src = "images/picture3.png" style = "width: 5%">
#### [**click here to view Github Repository**](https://github.com/chonieny/Hate_Crime_Factors_project)
<p class = "comment">
<font size = "3"> This project aims to build a <span style = "color:brown"> **multiple linear regression model** </span> to identify factors that are most closely associated with hate crime rates in the US. With the number of hate crimes jumping at an alarming rate, there is a growing urgency to find trends within the hate crime data that can assist the law enforcement agencies and the FBI to better address and prevent future incidents.<br/>
<br/>
**Techniques used**: Global F-test, Backward Elimination, Correlation Analysis, Model diagnostics
