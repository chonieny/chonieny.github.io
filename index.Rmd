### About Me

Hi, I am a Data Science and Biostatistics Master's student in Columbia University, graduating in October 2022.<br />
My journey to data science has started from being heavily involved with computational neuroscience research<br />
in undergraduate and post-graduate, where I was able to really confirm my passion for analyzing data 
and<br/> turning them into meaningful insights.
This led me to my current graduate program, where I have not only<br/> learned about data science and statistics in depth, but also have gotten a lot of hands-on experience through<br/> projects and work experience through internships.
Please check out some of my data science projects!
